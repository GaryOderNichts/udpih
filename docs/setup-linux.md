# Linux
## Device specific steps
Some devices require additional setup for UDPIH to work. Click on the device you want to use:

<details>
  <summary><strong>Raspberry Pi Zero (W) / A / A+ / Zero 2 W / 4 / 5 (Expand)</strong></summary>

  > :information_source: For the Pi Zero and Zero 2 W you will need 2 USB cables, one for powering the Zero and one which can be connected to the Wii U.  

  > :information_source: For the Pi 4 and 5 you need to provide power through the power headers because the USB-C port is the only port the supports USB OTG and must get connected to the Wii U. Unfortunately, when trying to power the Pi over USB-C using the Wii U's USB ports, the Pi doesn't boot fast enough. The USB-A ports do not support USB OTG and cannot be used for this exploit: you **must** connect the USB-C port to the Wii U during the exploit.

  > :information_source: This guide expects that you use Raspberry Pi OS.

  To use USB gadgets(OTG) you need to enable `dwc2` by running the command below:  
  > :warning: Prior to Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm, Raspberry Pi OS stored the boot partition at `/boot/`.  

  ```bash
  echo "dtoverlay=dwc2" | sudo tee -a /boot/firmware/config.txt
  ```

  After running the command reboot the system.  

  To install the required dependencies run the command below:  
  ```bash
  sudo apt install git build-essential raspberrypi-kernel-headers
  ```

<details>
  <summary><strong>Steam Deck (Expand)</strong></summary>

  To build and use UDPIH on the Steam Deck, you need to disable the read-only filesystem and initialize the pacman keyring.
  If you haven't done this before you can follow [this guide](https://steamdecki.org/SteamOS/Read-only_Filesystem).

  Install the required dependencies by running the command below:
  ```bash
  sudo pacman -S base-devel
  ```

  Next you need to install the required linux headers. Start with figuring out the kernel version by running the following command:
  ```bash
  uname -r
  ```
  You'll get an output like this:
  ```bash
  6.1.52-valve16-1-neptune-61
  ```
  In this case you'd want to install the linux headers for neptune-61:
  ```bash
  sudo pacman -S linux-neptune-61-headers # replace neptune-61 with your kernel version
  ```

  Next you'll have to enable USB Dual Role Device in the BIOS:
  - Power off the Steam Deck.
  - Enter the BIOS by holding the Volume Up (+) button and pressing the Power button.
  - Select `Setup Utility`.
  - Navigate to `Advanced` > `USB Configuration` and select `USB Dual Role Device`.
  - Change it from `XHCI` to `DRD`.
  - Navigate to `Exit` and select `Exit Saving Changes`.

## Building the UDPIH gadget
- Clone the repo:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/GaryOderNichts/udpih.git
    cd udpih
    ```
- Download the latest `arm_kernel.bin.h` from the [releases page](https://github.com/GaryOderNichts/udpih/releases) and copy it to the `arm_kernel` directory.  
  You can also simply run:
    ```bash
    curl -L https://github.com/GaryOderNichts/udpih/releases/latest/download/arm_kernel.bin.h > arm_kernel/arm_kernel.bin.h
    ```
- Now build the kernel module:
    ```bash
    cd linux
    make
    ```

## Running the UDPIH gadget

Start your device and leave it running for the duration of the exploit. You will leave the device on for all attempts at getting the timing right.

Run the command below to insert the kernel module into the kernel:
```bash
sudo insmod udpih.ko
```

The device is now ready to be used for udpih.

> :information_source: If you reboot your udpih device, you will need to load the kernel module again with the above command.

Continue with ["Booting the recovery_menu"](../README.md#booting-the-recovery_menu).

## Additional information

If you want to remove the module from the kernel:
```bash
sudo rmmod udpih
```

To show logs and debug information:
```bash
sudo dmesg -w
```
